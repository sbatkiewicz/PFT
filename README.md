Personal Finance Tracker
Personal Finance Tracker (PFT) is an independant program I developed myself using Java Swing and SQLite.
It is a simple program that allows a user to log in or create an account (locally) and track their finances. 
The program displays a purchase history, as well as a category break down of all purchases and their respective percents. 
The user can then choose to add a new purchase, or add income to add to their current savings.

I have also provided a complete installation file if you'd like to try it yourself!
